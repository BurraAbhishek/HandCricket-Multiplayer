        <h1>About this site</h1>
        <div class="text-padded">
            This site is a free, adless, open-source hand cricket server, powered by volunteers.
            <br>
            <br>
            There are several servers for board games, but making one for a team game is not easy. 
            In addition to that, there are several online sports games which you can play, but most 
            of them serve advertisements, or contain hidden trackers and paywalls.
            <br>
            <br>
            Cricket is an outdoor sport. During the COVID-19 pandemic, several safety measures were 
            implemented by governments. People were not allowed to play in groups to protect themselves 
            from the deadly SARS-CoV-2 virus. Thus, many resorted to playing online.
            <br>
            <br>
            Online cricket is not as effective as outdoor cricket. Thus, to make things simpler, this site 
            hosts a much simpler mode of playing cricket. Despite being hand cricket, the 
            <a href="https://www.lords.org/mcc/the-laws-of-cricket">Laws of Cricket</a> 
            which can be implemented in online settings are fully supported.
            <br>
            <br>
            The initial idea was to fork the <a href="https://github.com/ornicar/lila">source code</a> of  
            <a href="https://lichess.org">Lichess</a>, the most popular free and open-source online chess 
            server. However, we soon came to realize that major rewriting was needed, since analysis, 
            learning and puzzles were not a part of this hand cricket website.
            <br>
            <br>
            The logic of the game is already available on 
            <a href="https://github.com/BurraAbhishek/Python-Hand-Cricket">GitHub</a>. 
            This site will use the same logic, since 
            that is also open-source. For this reason, this site is written using Django instead of the 
            Play Framework as was earlier planned.
            <br>
            <br>
            Nevertheless, this site will be forever free and open-source without any advertisements or 
            trackers. Major pieces of layout and text were copied from Lichess, although the UI differs 
            in color and dimensions. So a big word of thanks to Thibault Duplessis for his brilliant piece 
            of work <a href="https://lichess.org">lichess.org</a>, the other lichess 
            <a href="https://github.com/ornicar/lila/graphs/contributors">developers</a> and the 
            open-source community in general.
            <br>
            <br>
            This site is still in its early stages of development; there are going to be bugs and missing 
            features, but we are trying to improve the site as much as we can. The source code is 
            available on <a href="https://github.com/BurraAbhishek/HandCricket-Multiplayer">GitHub</a>.
