            If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
            network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
            get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its
            interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive
            of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different
            solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
            specific requirements.
